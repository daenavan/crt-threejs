# ðŸ“º CRT Shader Effect - Three.js

An interactive CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor simulation built with Three.js and custom GLSL shaders that transforms any uploaded image into a nostalgic retro display with authentic effects including adjustable scanlines, barrel distortion, chromatic aberration, vignette, noise, and flicker. Simply upload an image, adjust the real-time controls to fine-tune the vintage aesthetic, and download your creation as a high-quality PNG. Perfect for digital art, game development, or anyone wanting to add that classic CRT monitor look to their images. [**Try the live demo â†’**](https://daenavan.github.io/crt-threejs/)
